      <description>“Autosave notes”, it is a pretty important feature for any note taking app. Having autosave enabled and running in the background saves you from loosing any important notes you have taken. We would have felt autosave itself is a kind of backup feature for your notes.
Recently, I had been in a situation where the autosave feature of boostnote misbehaved and lost all my notes till date. It’s a big disappointment.</description>

      <description>Key Takeaways  Erlang provides lightweight processes, immutability, distribution with location transparency, message passing, supervision behaviors and many other high-level, dynamic features that make it great for fault-tolerant, highly available, and scalable systems. Unfortunately, Erlang is less than optimal at doing low-level stuff such as XML parsing, since dealing with anything that comes from outside of the Erlang VM into it is tedious For this kind of use cases, one could be tempted to consider a different language.</description>
