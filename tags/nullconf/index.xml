      <description>Nullconf is one of the largest conferences in security started in 2010 (as I keep hearing that from everyone). This is the first time I have ever attended a security conference and was little over excited too. I had been there for two days and took a load of quite interesting aspects of security domain as a whole. Lot of less known and discussed topics like hardware hacking in real-time, security in the post quantum era, AI in threat detection and mitigation, vulnerability of existing telecom networking infrastructure etc are few highlights of the event.</description>
