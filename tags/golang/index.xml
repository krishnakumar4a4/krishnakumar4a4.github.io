While Work From Home is kind of boon, living with it for a long time comes with its own unique challenges. One of the simplest challenge I have faced in the initial days was to make my family understand that I am in a meeting where Mic/Camera/both are activated.</description>

      <description>On corporate networks, we always have a problem of having restrictions on internet access to applications.

How to run ./go-ssh-reverse-tunnel -u &amp;lt;username for SSH&amp;gt; -i &amp;lt;private key file path&amp;gt; -t &amp;lt;target ssh host name&amp;gt; -p &amp;lt;reverse tunnel listening port on target&amp;gt;</description>
