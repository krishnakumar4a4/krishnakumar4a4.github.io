So many of you have gotten accustomed to work from home by now. This pandemic has thrown a lot of challenges at our face when most of us are not ready for. While Work From Home is kind of boon, living with it for a long time comes with its own unique challenges. One of the simplest challenge I have faced in the initial days was to make my family understand that I am in a meeting where Mic/Camera/both are activated. It was becoming difficult sometimes to respond back to the family members for very trivial things while I am listening to a crucial conversation on zoom or trying to answer an important question on an ongoing video chat. Of course they understand that I am in work and it is difficult for me to respond. But these things can slowly be the trends at your home.

Gestures are great way to convey the same. But they don't always go smooth on the receiving side especially when you do them for visitors.

As a technologist, we should be able to tackle this better.

- How about sending text messages to family members when you are on/off meeting(May be overwhelming)
- Share your calendar with family members? (How to deal with unscheduled ones?)
- Mobile app to show your availability(Too much of work?)
- How about placing visual indicators at our desk? (Can be a Good starter)
I have picked up the last idea out of all the above ones which seems doable with relatively little effort. Back to hardware mode.
