      <description>On a winter morning before the first light I was going on my bike on a silent road in the early hours of the day. The road looks entirely abandoned as it was one of the most chilling days of winter and I was not expecting anyone coming on to the road. But I was very much ambivalent and kept an eye on both sides of the road as far I can see through the fog.</description>

      <description>Nullconf is one of the largest conferences in security started in 2010 (as I keep hearing that from everyone). This is the first time I have ever attended a security conference and was little over excited too. I had been there for two days and took a load of quite interesting aspects of security domain as a whole. Lot of less known and discussed topics like hardware hacking in real-time, security in the post quantum era, AI in threat detection and mitigation, vulnerability of existing telecom networking infrastructure etc are few highlights of the event.</description>

      <description>Internet of things is a buzz now. In simpler terms, connecting all the things to the internet so that they are monitored and controlled from anywhere.
What is the most common protocol of internet. It is http. You open a browser enter a url and then you see content on your browser. How is that working? When you enter a url, your browser makes http get request to the site and fetches the content.</description>
