      <description>“Autosave notes”, it is a pretty important feature for any note taking app. Having autosave enabled and running in the background saves you from loosing any important notes you have taken. We would have felt autosave itself is a kind of backup feature for your notes.
Recently, I had been in a situation where the autosave feature of boostnote misbehaved and lost all my notes till date. It’s a big disappointment.</description>

      <description>I am a tech enthusiast and I love to attend lot of meetups, conferences, events etc. The reason I attend them is
to get introduced to new technologies hear perspectives of people on technologies known to me Conference hall setup: Conference Hall Setup chuttersnap
Usually be a sparsely distributed clusters of people sitting relaxedly all over.
Some of the talks I attended will be so immersive and I couldn’t afford having even a slighter distraction fearing I would loose context.</description>
